15 Aug 2014: First set of files available for download from SOL,
             based on those for lsqrSOL.
             Craig's method solves min ||x|| st Ax = b.
             It is simpler than LSQR and therefore may run
             slightly faster (but the number of iterations
             is likely to be very similar).
